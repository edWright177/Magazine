Overcrowding in National Parks in the United States has posed a significant threat to the preservation and continued enjoyment of National Parks by tourists and recreationists from around the world. This is an issue that has received much media attention recently, with numerous major publications tackling it. This magazine aggregates various works that I have produced regarding the topic, and should represent my personal understanding and attitudes towards it. I find this issue relevant because I enjoy climbing in national parks, and it is therefore in my interest, and in that of those in communities I am a part of, to preserve them. I also find the venture of protecting natural environments from human intrusion somewhat noble, and should be given more attention from legislators and government agencies. 

On this website, you will find four pages: The homepage (links), a directory containing links to other pages and basic information about the site; an “about” page, which you have already found; a project gallery (link), containing the aforementioned works regarding the site’s topic, revised and enhanced; and a works cited page (link), formatted in MLA style. Most (all) of the external works referenced are other websites, many of which are from the national park service’s site or from major publications which, as aforementioned, have covered the issue.  

Each page is meant for a specific purpose, which should be explained by its title. This, however, does not mean that each page functions independently. In particular, the works cited page is essential to the project gallery. The directory serves to introduce the issue at hand and the rest of the magazine’s pages. This page, the “about” page, contains this.

I encourage you to apply the information contained in this website to better understand and respect this country’s national parks; its goal is to inform, but it is up to you to decide what to do with this information. While the scope of the website is mostly contained within Utah, the same problems, and their potential solutions, are relevant across the nation. As such, it is important to provide adequate attention to all national parks and issues relating to them.

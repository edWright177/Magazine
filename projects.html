<memoir>
Utah is among the fastest growing states in the US (by population), and is currently the 15th most visited. Recently, many people have traveled or moved to Utah to participate in the various outdoor activities that are popular in the region. The five national parks (those being Bryce Canyon; Arches; Zion; Canyonlands; and Capitol Reef) attracted a total of 9.5 million visitors in 2019, out of the 20.97 million total Utah tourists in 2019. In the Wasatch mountain range, skiing, climbing, and biking attract many. With so many people attracted to the state, overcrowding has become somewhat of an issue, leading to environmental and practical problems, as is the case in Big Cottonwood Canyon, which has become increasingly popular for its plentiful skiing between its two resorts. 
I was born in Salt Lake City, and lived in Big Cottonwood Canyon for the first few years of my life. I, of course, have little memory of those years. My parents divorced when I was about two, and my mother moved to West Virginia, while my father continued to live in Big Cottonwood Canyon, as he would for about eight years afterward. I lived in West Virginia about two-thirds of the time, where I attended school.
The time I did spend in Utah encompassed school breaks -holidays- when ski traffic was the heaviest. However, at that point in time, the traffic was not excessive, nor was there extensive overcrowding in the canyon. It always seemed fairly isolated, even as the ski season was at its peak. There simply weren’t that many people trying to ski in the canyon, as there were fewer people living in Utah.
Last year, my mother moved back to the canyon. Nowadays, the canyon is busy, loud, and crowded. Traffic is very prevalent, especially in the mid-morning and late afternoon, with a single line of cars sometimes stretching down the entire 15-mile long canyon. Noise and light from night skiing and traffic is generally disruptive for residents, such as myself. The canyon was once quiet at night, but it now feels almost indistinguishable from the Salt Lake valley.
At nearly every point in my life, I have lived in Big Cottonwood Canyon, and in my lifetime, I have seen the change in the canyon, namely the growth and overgrowth of the ski industry. Big Cottonwood has gone from a quiet skiing retreat to a busy and overcrowded collection of people and cars. The formerly pristine forest has been replaced with excessive numbers of recreators.

Big Cottonwood Canyon is located near Salt Lake City, Utah. It is perhaps best known for its skiing, both in and out of the canyon’s two ski resorts, Brighton and Solitude. Many are also attracted to the canyon for hiking, biking, and general sightseeing. It is located inside the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. National forests are not given the same conservation status as national parks, and instead are exploited more freely. 
Alex Wheeler is a long-time resident of the canyon. He has lived in Utah since 1995, first in Little Cottonwood Canyon, before moving to Big Cottonwood Canyon in 2005, where he has resided since. Alex enjoys skiing, mountain biking, fishing, and hunting, or, as he puts it, “killing and grilling”, across the Wasatch range.
Brighton ski resort, one of two in Big Cottonwood Canyon, was founded in 1936, making it the first of its kind in Utah. Utah has long been a popular skiing destination; Utah has the “Greatest Snow on Earth”, as the state’s license plates might attest to. Brighton, along with Solitude (the other ski resort in Big Cottonwood Canyon) attract skiers from around the world. In 2014, Deer Valley Resort, located in Park City, Utah, purchased Solitude. This new ownership meant that more skiers were made aware of Solitude, as Alex says, “[the purchase] kind of put Solitude on the map”. While this increased the “local awareness” of the resort, and by extension, Big Cottonwood skiing in general, major change did not occur until 2018, when Solitude was purchased by Deer Valley’s parent company, Alterra (based in Denver). This purchase meant access to Solitude was granted by the Ikon pass, further increasing the popularity of the resort. Accessibility, in the form of improved outdoor equipment, has increased rapidly in recent years, leading to a further increase in the popularity of the ski resorts..
Mountain biking, which requires long stretches of well-established trail, and is inherently destructive to the ground which it requires, is particularly disruptive. Alex says that, when he moved here, there were very few mountain biking trails in Solitude. Now, however, Solitude allows summer lift access for biking. Many more trails exist now. This increased accessibility increases the volume of skiers, and, as a result, environmental destruction. Brighton is also planning to develop mountain biking trails soon. Alex points to shuttle businesses as increasing the popularity of mountain biking in the region. Shuttles increase access, by providing transportation and guidance, to mountain biking in the canyon and all around Utah.
With so many people attempting to recreate in the canyon, trash accumulates along the road. In 2018, Americans produced a total of 292.4 million tons of trash. Along the roads, trails, and in ski resorts, people produce and distribute waste; gloves, cigarettes, and general waste, are commonplace near the top of the canyon. This affects the Big Cottonwood Canyon watershed, polluting water that leads into the Salt Lake valley.
Traffic is also a major consideration in the canyon. The “red snake” (referring to the taillights of cars) in Big Cottonwood sometimes stretches the entire canyon, which is 15 miles long. Especially in the winter (during ski season) traffic becomes unavoidable in the mid-morning and late afternoon, as people are trying to access the ski resorts, or return home, respectively. Alex says that one major factor that has led to increased traffic is the paving of Guardsman Pass road, which connects Big Cottonwood to the Heber valley. This new route allowed more people from both sides of the canyon to access the ski resorts.
Housing developments have disrupted certain natural environments, such as Tavaci, which is near the bottom of the canyon. Alex claims that the Tavaci development was placed in the wintering grounds of the canyon’s mule deer population. Such displacement is common in many formerly natural areas around the world, generally disrupting migratory patterns.
Big Cottonwood Canyon has, as a residential area, grown significantly in the last few decades. 1994 was the last year that rifle hunting was permitted in both Little and Big Cottonwood. Alex, a hunter himself, says that it would be “nearly unthinkable” to allow rifle hunting amidst the current population in the canyon.

Big Cottonwood Canyon is a beautiful place that should be preserved, but the recent growth in the outdoor industry has subverted that concept. Utah is filled with natural wonders that deserve better treatment from the influx of new recreators and tourists. The canyon is just one example; regions across the state have been subject to decreased regulations, increased levels of recreation, and therefore, their formerly pristine nature has become tarnished by the influx of tourists and recreators.

Context: Park Service and National Park history
The National Park Service, or NPS, was established in 1916, with the self-proclaimed goal of “safeguarding” America’s national parks. The organization strives to preserve the “natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations” (“What We Do (US National Park Service)”). National Parks were created as a way to showcase natural environments without intruding on them, which can be a difficult task, given that national park visitation numbers have increased dramatically in recent years (with the exception of 2020 and 2021, where visitation subsided dramatically, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic.).
Summarize statistics and lead into modern day issue (chronological statistics)
A number of factors have contributed to the recent influx of tourists, such as social media, modern infrastructure, and simply an increase in the US population since the founding of the park service. Summarize four years for a trend (ALL AREAS UNDER NPS, not just national parks): 1904: 120,690 (first year data available), 1940: 16,410,148, 1980: 220,463,211, and 2016 (absolute maximum): 330,971,689 (“Visitation Numbers (US National Park Service)”).
Introduce overcrowding issue, with examples and problems that arise
 The unprecedented volume of visitors has led to a number of problems, as tourists tend to clash somewhat with the environments of national parks. Traffic, trash, obstruction and destruction of the natural environment, etc. (People everywhere taking pictures - narrative scene implementation). Improving infrastructure (which is, in many national parks, severely outdated) is the most obvious solution to accommodate visitors, but the primary issue with that solution is that accommodations tend to intrude even further on the land anyway. What is the point of having national parks if they are essentially the same as cities? 
Explain what the park service has done
The Park Service has made efforts to resolve these issues. Lottery, restricted access.
Justify the NPS’ actions: The NPS has limited resources, balancing visitor’s wants and conservation is incredibly difficult.
The park service is really cool
Criticize and offer a better solution: The NPS is not doing all they can, leaning too heavily towards accommodating visitors, abandoning the initial premise of a national park.
The park service really sucks
Evaluate response as a whole (final draft)
This is a complex issue, where no one solution fully encompasses all issues at play. To handle overcrowding by improving infrastructure would be to intrude on and destroy the very environments which the visitors seek in the first place.

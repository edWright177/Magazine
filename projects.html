        This project provides some insight into my personal experience with overcrowding problems, and uses a pure text-based format.
        <br><br>
        Utah is among the fastest growing states in the US (by population), and is currently the 15th most visited. Recently, many people have traveled or moved to Utah to participate in the various outdoor activities that are popular in the region. The five national parks (those being Bryce Canyon; Arches; Zion; Canyonlands; and Capitol Reef) attracted a total of 9.5 million visitors in 2019, out of the 20.97 million total Utah tourists in 2019. In the Wasatch mountain range, skiing, climbing, and biking attract many. With so many people attracted to the state, overcrowding has become somewhat of an issue, leading to environmental and practical problems, as is the case in Big Cottonwood Canyon, which has become increasingly popular for its plentiful skiing between its two resorts. 
        
         <br><br>
        I was born in Salt Lake City, and lived in Big Cottonwood Canyon for the first few years of my life. I, of course, have little memory of those years. My parents divorced when I was about two, and my mother moved to West Virginia, while my father continued to live in Big Cottonwood Canyon, as he would for about eight years afterward. I lived in West Virginia about two-thirds of the time, where I attended school.
          
        
         <br><br>
        The time I did spend in Utah encompassed school breaks -holidays- when ski traffic was the heaviest. However, at that point in time, the traffic was not excessive, nor was there extensive overcrowding in the canyon. It always seemed fairly isolated, even as the ski season was at its peak. There simply weren’t that many people trying to ski in the canyon, as there were fewer people living in Utah.
          
        
         <br><br>
        Last year, my mother moved back to the canyon. Nowadays, the canyon is busy, loud, and crowded. Traffic is very prevalent, especially in the mid-morning and late afternoon, with a single line of cars sometimes stretching down the entire 15-mile long canyon. Noise and light from night skiing and traffic is generally disruptive for residents, such as myself. The canyon was once quiet at night, but it now feels almost indistinguishable from the Salt Lake valley.
          
        
         <br><br>
        At nearly every point in my life, I have lived in Big Cottonwood Canyon, and in my lifetime, I have seen the change in the canyon, namely the growth and overgrowth of the ski industry. Big Cottonwood has gone from a quiet skiing retreat to a busy and overcrowded collection of people and cars. The formerly pristine forest has been replaced with an excessive volume of recreationists.

        This project showcases Alex Wheeler, a long-time resident of Big Cottonwood Canyon (which has been subject to overcrowding) and his perspective on that issue.
        <br><br>
        Big Cottonwood Canyon is located near Salt Lake City, Utah. It is perhaps best known for its skiing, both in and out of the canyon’s two ski resorts, Brighton and Solitude. Many are also attracted to the canyon for hiking, biking, and general sightseeing. It is located inside the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. National forests are not given the same conservation status as national parks, and instead are exploited more freely. 
        <br><br>
       Alex Wheeler is a long-time resident of the canyon. He has lived in Utah since 1995, first in Little Cottonwood Canyon, before moving to Big Cottonwood Canyon in 2005, where he has resided since. Alex enjoys skiing, mountain biking, fishing, and hunting, or, as he puts it, “killing and grilling”, across the Wasatch range.
        <br><br>
       Brighton ski resort, one of two in Big Cottonwood Canyon, was founded in 1936, making it the first of its kind in Utah. Utah has long been a popular skiing destination; Utah has the “Greatest Snow on Earth”, as the state’s license plates might attest to. Brighton, along with Solitude (the other ski resort in Big Cottonwood Canyon) attract skiers from around the world. In 2014, Deer Valley Resort, located in Park City, Utah, purchased Solitude. This new ownership meant that more skiers were made aware of Solitude, as Alex says, “[the purchase] kind of put Solitude on the map”. While this increased the “local awareness” of the resort, and by extension, Big Cottonwood skiing in general, major change did not occur until 2018, when Solitude was purchased by Deer Valley’s parent company, Alterra (based in Denver). This purchase meant access to Solitude was granted by the Ikon pass, further increasing the popularity of the resort. Accessibility, in the form of improved outdoor equipment, has increased rapidly in recent years, leading to a further increase in the popularity of the ski resorts..
        <br><br>
       Mountain biking, which requires long stretches of well-established trail, and is inherently destructive to the ground which it requires, is particularly disruptive. Alex says that, when he moved here, there were very few mountain biking trails in Solitude. Now, however, Solitude allows summer lift access for biking. Many more trails exist now. This increased accessibility increases the volume of skiers, and, as a result, environmental destruction. Brighton is also planning to develop mountain biking trails soon. Alex points to shuttle businesses as increasing the popularity of mountain biking in the region. Shuttles increase access, by providing transportation and guidance, to mountain biking in the canyon and all around Utah.
        <br><br>
       With so many people attempting to recreate in the canyon, trash accumulates along the road. In 2018, Americans produced a total of 292.4 million tons of trash. Along the roads, trails, and in ski resorts, people produce and distribute waste; gloves, cigarettes, and general waste, are commonplace near the top of the canyon. This affects the Big Cottonwood Canyon watershed, polluting water that leads into the Salt Lake valley.
        <br><br>
       Traffic is also a major consideration in the canyon. The “red snake” (referring to the taillights of cars) in Big Cottonwood sometimes stretches the entire canyon, which is 15 miles long. Especially in the winter (during ski season) traffic becomes unavoidable in the mid-morning and late afternoon, as people are trying to access the ski resorts, or return home, respectively. Alex says that one major factor that has led to increased traffic is the paving of Guardsman Pass road, which connects Big Cottonwood to the Heber valley. This new route allowed more people from both sides of the canyon to access the ski resorts.
        <br><br>
       Housing developments have disrupted certain natural environments, such as Tavaci, which is near the bottom of the canyon. Alex claims that the Tavaci development was placed in the wintering grounds of the canyon’s mule deer population. Such displacement is common in many formerly natural areas around the world, generally disrupting migratory patterns.
        <br><br>
       Big Cottonwood Canyon has, as a residential area, grown significantly in the last few decades. 1994 was the last year that rifle hunting was permitted in both Little and Big Cottonwood. Alex, a hunter himself, says that it would be “nearly unthinkable” to allow rifle hunting amidst the current population in the canyon.
        <br><br>
       Big Cottonwood Canyon is a beautiful place that should be preserved, but the recent growth in the outdoor industry has subverted that concept. Utah is filled with natural wonders that deserve better treatment from the influx of new recreators and tourists. The canyon is just one example; regions across the state have been subject to decreased regulations, increased levels of recreation, and therefore, their formerly pristine nature has become tarnished by the influx of tourists and recreators.

        This project serves to inform you, reader, in an objective way about overcrowding, specifically in National Parks, in an audio-based format. Included here are the script and recording of it.
<br><br>      
Tourism is one of Utah’s largest industries; in 2021, the state's five national parks attracted a total of 11.3 million visitors. While this might be beneficial for local economies, numerous practical and environmental concerns have emerged in recent years, as national parks become increasingly overwhelmed with tourists. 
<br><br>
Increased access to outdoor recreation and tourism enables a much larger volume of tourists and recreationists to visit national parks and other such outdoor areas. This can be attributed to improved infrastructure, modern recreation equipment, guide services, and the sharing of information about outdoor areas online, especially through social media. Social media has acted as a sort of catalyst for the influx of visitors, particularly image-oriented platforms such as Instagram; many tourists seek to take photos of landscapes in national parks to share them online.
<br><br>
National park visitation in the United States increased dramatically over the course of the last decade. Including all areas under the National Park System (such as National Recreation Areas), 327 million total visitors were recorded in 2019, a number only 1 million less than the US population in that year, with 89.82 million of those being from National Parks alone, compared to the 281 million total visitors and 64.62 million National Park Visitors in 2010. There was a major decrease in visitation in 2020, with only 67.93 million visitors to national parks, a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic continued into 2021’s figures, which were also notably lower than the 2019 maximum, although more visitors were recorded in 2021 than 2020.
<br><br>
The most practical problem that has arisen due to these trends is overcrowding. Not only does this reduce the supposedly pristine state that national parks are intended to have, but overcrowding also leads to traffic, which can inhibit access to national parks and further contributes to the deterioration of them. Interestingly, the extreme influx of tourists tapers itself to some degree because of this effect; overcrowding is not exactly appealing to potential visitors. Infrastructure, such as roads and trails, in many National Parks has also degraded from excessive use, and is in desperate need of repair. Part of the issue, however, is that accommodating so many visitors is potentially equally as destructive as the visitors themselves; including adequate parking, for example, would require large parts of many national parks to be siphoned off for what is essentially land development. It is important to address these problems without destroying the natural environment, which, considering the sheer volume of tourists, is very difficult to do. 
<br><br>
An increase in visitors also threatens the natural environments that national parks are intended to preserve. This is especially true in recreational areas with looser regulations and restrictions, where more destructive activities are permitted, such as national forests, which are not protected to quite the same degree as national parks. Tourists have a habit of interfering with natural environments, which is not just destructive (in the case of flora) but also mutually dangerous (in the case of fauna). This side of the issue is very difficult: how can the Park Service seek to protect natural environments while allowing tourists to admire them, without the latter interfering with the former?

        This project serves to evaluate the Park Service’s response to the overcrowding problem in National Parks, using an audio-based format. Included here are the script and a recording of it.
        <br><br>
        The National Park Service, or NPS, was established in 1916, with the self-proclaimed goal of “safeguarding” America’s national parks. The organization strives to preserve the “natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations” (“What We Do (US National Park Service)”). National Parks were created as a way to showcase natural environments without intruding on them, which can be a difficult task, given that national park visitation numbers have increased dramatically in recent years (with the exception of 2020 and 2021, where visitation subsided dramatically, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic).
        <br><br>
        A number of factors have contributed to the recent influx of tourists, such as the use of social media, modern infrastructure, and simply an increase in the US population since the founding of the park service. In 1904, the first year where this statistic is available, 120,690 visitors to national parks were recorded. By 1940, that number had climbed to 16 million, and reached its all-time peak in 2016, at 330 million, not far from the US population as a whole. (“Visitation Numbers (US National Park Service))”.
        <br><br>
         The unprecedented volume of visitors has led to a number of problems, as tourists tend to clash somewhat with the environments of national parks. More visitors means more traffic and trash, which leads to the obstruction and destruction of the lands that the park service seeks to protect. Improving infrastructure (which is, in many national parks, severely outdated) is the most obvious solution to better accommodate visitors, but the primary issue there is that adding infrastructure further intrudes on natural environments, making them less natural. What is the point of having national parks if they are essentially the same as cities? That defeats the initial and intended purpose of national parks; there is no sense in visiting a place that is meant to resemble your own home and its comforts, right?
        <br><br>
        The Park Service has made efforts to resolve these issues. Certain areas limit visitation by simply rejecting visitors, while others, such as Zion National Park, have implemented lottery systems to allow individuals access on a limited scale. Of course, the park service can’t simply block all tourists from visiting, as that would defeat the other purpose of national parks, being, to allow visitors to enjoy them. The NPS has limited resources and capability, and balancing visitor’s wants and conservation of the parks is an incredibly difficult task, so perhaps the park service is doing all that can be done; perhaps there is no complete solution, no obvious balance between accommodating visitors and preserving the parks.
        <br><br>
        But perhaps the NPS is not doing all they can, leaning too heavily towards accommodating visitors, abandoning the initial premise of a national park; the actions of the park service have clearly not eliminated the issue. More must be done to preserve the parks, and perhaps that means further restricting visitors. While that might not fare well in the eyes of the public, it remains closer to the original concept and purpose of national parks, as stated by the park service itself. 
        <br><br>
        This is indeed a complex issue, where no one solution fully accounts for all factors and outcomes. To handle overcrowding by improving infrastructure would be to intrude on and destroy the very environments which the visitors seek in the first place, while intentionally reducing visitation would equally violate the premise of a national park. The park service is clearly aware of the problem, and has implemented measures to manage it, but until the issue is solved, it has not done enough.
